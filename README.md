# QueSera

```
Que ser치, ser치
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que ser치, ser치
What will be, will be
```
--- The song "Que Sera, Sera" by Doris Day, 1956

## Intro

The e-ink smart calendar that I've been too busy and nearly forgot to continue working on.

The original project is here: [https://github.com/huming2207/Hindle](https://github.com/huming2207/Hindle).

Now I have just finished my major assignments in this semester. 
So I finally got some time in the SWOT VAC week to deal with the stuff I have planned to do earlier this year.
